    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let stringEx = "My string";
    let numberEx = 2002;
    let boolEx = true;

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const players2 = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    players2[3] = 'Jay';
    console.log(players2);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const myArray = players.slice();
    myArray[3] = 'Jay';
    console.log(myArray);
    console.log(players);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const myArray2 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const myArray3 = [...players];

    const myArray4 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const newObject = person;
    newObject.id = 2000;
    console.log(person); // Person will include the id

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const newObject2 = Object.assign({}, person, {id: 2000});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const newObject3 = {...person};
    console.log(newObject3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const jay = {
      name: 'Jay',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@jaymond36',
        facebook: 'jay.evans'
      }
    }
    console.log(jay);

    // Object.assign() only does one level deep, so social will receive the changes to the copy
    const jayCopy = Object.assign({}, jay);

    console.log(jayCopy);

    // JSON.stringify changes Jay to a string, JSON.parse changes the string back to a new copy of the object
    const jayCopy2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(jay));
